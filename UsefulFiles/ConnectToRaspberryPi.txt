The easiest way to connect to the raspberrypi is an SSH connection. eduroam wifi makes it a little tricky. In order to ensure a static IP address, one can use the hotspot from a laptop or phone that provides a static intermediary between eduroam and the pi.

If you need to set up the pi (or reset), see the SetupPi.sh shell script file and SetupPi.txt.

The pi is configured to look for a network with the following properties:
SSID (Network Name): StepperWifi
Password: mercury1201

Other pi configuration properties:
Hostname: pi.local
Username: blake
Password: hg1201

On windows, one can use a powershell (same command on macOS and linux) with the following command:
ssh blake@pi

You now have a direct connection to control the pi. The SSH connection will stop running any control scrips if you close the SSH connection. To allow for network disconnections (so you can take your laptop home), the next step is to set up tmux. Into the SSH terminal type:
tmux

This creates new shell that runs indepentantly from SSH, so you can connect/disconnect (attach/detach) while any process remains running with the commands:
tmux a (type this is ssh terminal to attach tmux window that is already started)

While in tmux, you can detach the from the window with the hot key "ctl b" then let go and press "d"
Similarly, one can kill tmux window with "ctl b" then &


Now in the tmux shell navigate to the control file directory with command:
cd BridgemanFurnace/ControlFiles
This is a git repository that can be used to update the files that you want to run. I highly recommend that you do not try to commit/upload anything from the pi because it is annoying, but its is very convienient for one to update the github repo and want to update the pi with the changes, by using:
git pull 
(be sure you are in the relavent path from above)

Adjust your sample's original height by running
python3 QuickStop.py
This will allow you to move it up and down using the buttons that are attached to the pi.

Now you should be able to run the newest version of your script e.g.:
python3 GrowthStepper.py
