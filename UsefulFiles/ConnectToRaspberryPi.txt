The easiest way to connect to the raspberrypi is an SSH connection. eduroam wifi makes it a little tricky. In order to ensure a static IP address, one can use the hotspot from a laptop or phone that provides a static intermediary between eduroam and the pi.

If you need to set up the pi (or reset), see the SetupPi.sh shell script file and SetupPi.txt.

The pi is configured to look for a network with the following properties:
SSID (Network Name): StepperWifi
Password: mercury1201

Other pi configuration properties:
Hostname: pi.local
Username: blake
Password: hg1201

On windows, one can use a powershell (same command on macOS and linux) with the following command:
ssh blake@pi.local

You now have a direct connection to control the pi. The SSH connection will stop running the control scrips if you close the SSH connection. To allow for disconnections, the next step is to set up tmux.

tmux (create new shell that runs indivially from SSH)
tmux a (attach)
tmux detach hot key "ctl b", "d"

bash test.sh
python3 scrpt.py
git pull

nano file
which bash
chmod u+x test.sh

mv: move/rename
rm: remove
cp: copy
scp: secure copy (ssh copy)
