# BridgemanFurnace
This is a repository that is made to be a manual for the home-built bridgeman furnace. This was built by Sudarsharn Sharma and Blake Wendland. Most of the materials and the orginal idea for the furnace were done by Zach Anderson.
For any questions, please email Blake at wendl198@umn.edu or blakewendland@gmail.com

The motion of this furnace is controlled by a 42BYGHW811 stepper motor. The stepper motor is controlled via a PhidgetStepper 1063_1 controller. This controller can be easily controlled in many ways, but my prefered choice is to use the python API.
